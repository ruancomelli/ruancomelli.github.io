Welcome to my personal website! I'm currently working on building and improving this space. Please check back soon for updates!

Most of the content in this page was generated by AI from my resume and README to get started. I'll be adjusting and adding more content with time.

Hi! I'm Ruan Comelli, a Software Engineer with a strong focus on AI, code quality, and developer tools. I'm currently exploring LLM-powered applications and automation, combining my passion for software development with my background in mechanical engineering.

## Background

I'm a Brazilian software developer living in the beautiful city of FlorianÃ³polis. While I'm a Mechanical Engineer by formal education (with both Bachelor's and Master's degrees from the Federal University of Santa Catarina), I'm a self-taught programmer at heart. This unique combination of backgrounds allows me to approach problems from both engineering and software development perspectives.

Beyond coding, I'm a dinosaur enthusiast, a proud father to two adorable chihuahuas, and an enthusiastic beach volleyball player. I also enjoy gaming, with Hollow Knight being my latest favorite.

## Professional Experience

### Sourcery (2021 â€“ 2025) - Senior Software Engineer

At Sourcery, I contributed to building intelligent tools for developers, focusing on:

- Designing and implementing LLM-powered systems for automated code review and bug fixing
- Re-architecting and maintaining an event-driven GitHub/GitLab bot infrastructure
- Implementing automated PR titles, summaries, and security-focused reviews
- Building evaluation datasets and scripts for AI-generated patches
- Modernizing the codebase with modern tooling like Ruff
- Enhancing static analysis and adding linting/refactoring rules

### Elint (2021) - Tech Lead

During my time at Elint, I:

- Led a team in developing an automated PDF data extraction solution
- Architected a custom OCR solution that outperformed commercial tools
- Designed and implemented serverless document processing pipelines

### Academic Research (2019 â€“ 2023)

During my Master's in Mechanical Engineering at UFSC, I:

- Applied deep learning to computer vision problems in mechanical engineering
- Developed models to estimate heat flux in pool boiling experiments
- Achieved significant improvements in prediction accuracy and model efficiency
- Published research in Applied Thermal Engineering

## Skills & Expertise

### Technical Skills

- Python development (libraries, packages, testing)
- LLM integration and prompt engineering
- Code quality tooling and static analysis
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Machine learning and computer vision
- Git workflows and version control
- Type-safe Python development
- Scientific software development

### Current Focus

- Learning Rust programming language
- Full-stack development
- Open-source contributions
- Building efficient developer tools

## Development Environment

<!-- TODO: move this to the blog section -->
<!-- TODO: Add more details about my favorite tools and workflows -->

I maintain a modern and efficient development setup:

- **Editor/IDE**: Cursor as main IDE, with Helix for quick edits
- **Terminal**: Alacritty with Zellij as multiplexer
- **Shell**: NuShell as primary, with Bash as fallback
- **OS**: Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS
- **Theme**: Dracula

My productivity toolkit includes various tools for shell enhancement, development, Git workflow, code quality, and knowledge management.

## Talks & Presentations

<!-- TODO: move this to the blog section -->

I occasionally share my knowledge through talks and presentations:

- **PyNE 2023**: "Building a Code Assistant Using LLMs" - [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Rzdi7Z3s1MRJF42AbdfPDUtiNPFk2YE8Vcmh3uyo-lY/edit?usp=sharing) | [Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRblTqqqJ04)
- **PyBR 2022**: "Refactoring: Best Practices and Automation" - [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1slpzFVb5e3MY8Tcx3HkdmwGVAMFOtxM1dsqOJx7pySE/edit?usp=sharing) | [Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNsWPcGgi3c)
