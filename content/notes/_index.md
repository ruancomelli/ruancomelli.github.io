A stream of quick thoughts, learnings, and observations. The unpolished, unfiltered side of my thinking.

Here you'll find:

- **TIL** (Today I Learned) moments
- **Random thoughts** and musings
- **Quick discoveries** from my work
- **Questions** I'm pondering
- **Mini-logs** of things I've done

Less formal than blog posts, more frequent than projects. Think of it as my digital notebook made public.
