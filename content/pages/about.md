I was born and still live in the beautiful city of [FlorianÃ³polis](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Florian%C3%B3polis), in the south of Brazil. Here, I share my home with my two ~crazy~ lovely chihuahuas, Jack and Bonnie, who truly and proudly believe they are a menace to society.

<!--

Intro: I'm Brazilian, living in FlorianÃ³polis, SC, Brazil.

I did my Bachelor's and Master's in Mechanical Engineering at the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC).

My passion for software development started in college, when I was pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering. We had two courses on Scientific Computing, and I was hooked. I soon joined a research group focused on computational fluid dynamics, working with the ~overly complex~ powerful C++ programming language.

I have worked as a software engineer for the past 5 years, mostly in the AI and developer tools space - Sourcery, Elint, Waivern and now <redacted>?
