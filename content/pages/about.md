I was born and still live in the beautiful city of [Florianópolis](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Florian%C3%B3polis), in the south of Brazil. Here, I live with my two ~bosses~ lovely chihuahuas, Jack and Bonnie, who truly believe they are menacing 

My passion for software development started in college, when I was pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering. We had two courses on Scientific Computing, and I was hooked. I soon joined a research group focused on computational fluid dynamics, working with the ~overly complex~ powerful C++ programming language.
