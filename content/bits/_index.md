**Quick thoughts, short posts - _bits_ of writing.**

The unpolished, unfiltered side of my thinking.
Less structured but more frequent than [blog](../blog) posts, bits are my space to write freely, without polish or compromise.
Here you'll find:

- **TIL** (Today I Learned) moments
- **Random thoughts**
- **Quick discoveries**
- **Questions** I'm asking myself (and sometimes my dogs) - feel free to answer them!
- **Mini-logs** of things I've done
