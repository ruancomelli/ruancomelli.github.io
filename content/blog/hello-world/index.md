Welcome to my blog!

In this first post, I want to go a bit _meta_: a post about the blog.

## Preface

I am human - at least, I ~almost~ always pass those checks that confirm I'm not a robot. And, as a human, I'm a social being: I enjoy listening to other people and I like to talk. I also like to read. And I think I like to write. And, who knows, maybe I'll write something that other humans enjoy reading - even if that other human is me in the future?

Not that I haven't written anything before: in fact, I've been writing for over 10 years. I write _code_. Code in programming languages. You know, things like `python -c 'while True: print("Weeee")'`. Things meant to be read, interpreted, compiled, consumed by computers. And I love it! Really. I made it my profession and sometimes I do it for fun.

But now I want to write things in other languages: less structured, more ambiguous, and with fewer restrictions. Things to be read and interpreted by humans.

In this endeavor, I want to share knowledge, experiences, and opinions. I want to practice writing freely, without structure and without pressure.

Given the moment we're going through, where so much content is obviously generated by Generative Artificial Intelligence models (GenAI), I need to leave a disclaimer: I'm also a GenAI user. On this site, I've already used GenAI to generate HTML and CSS, generate images, solve bugs that prevented the site from building, and I might even use it to translate posts between English and Portuguese. But **all original content will always be mine**. I promise.

## Site structure

This site was built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a static site generator, using the [tabi](https://welpo.github.io/tabi/) theme, and served through GitHub Pages. I plan to write [a post with the step-by-step guide on how I built this site](../building-the-blog/) soon.

The site structure is simple:

- [**Blog** (`/blog`)](../): where posts like this one live
- [**Archive** (`/archive`)](../../archive/): a chronological view of all posts, including blog, projects, and others
- [**Tags** (`/tags`)](../../tags/): a view of all content organized by tags
- [**Projects** (`/projects`)](../../projects/): a space with personal, professional, and academic projects - focused on development
- [**About** (`/about`)](../../about/): information about me
- [**Resume** (`/about/resume`)](../../about/resume/): complete information about my professional and academic experience

Additionally, the site is bilingual (Portuguese and English), with each page having its corresponding version in the other language. With this, I intend to reach people worldwide, but also give special care to Brazilians (who don't always have the privilege of knowing English).

I've also included light mode (for normal people) and dark mode (for tech folks) and a search function to find content throughout the entire site. At some point, I'll also include an Atom/RSS feed for those who want to follow my posts.

To allow me to interact with you, dear reader, I've enabled integration with [Giscus](https://giscus.app/) on all my posts - this way, you can comment and react to my posts. Visitors are expected to react with ❤️ to keep the creative flame burning - thank you very much.

## Closing

Thank you for reading this far. Feel free to explore the site, review the [code on GitHub](https://github.com/ruancomelli/ruancomelli.github.io), and leave comments - praising, criticizing, or expressing your opinion.

See you later, world!
